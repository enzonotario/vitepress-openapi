# Custom Slots

The `OAOperation` component provides several slots for customizing the operation layout.

## Description

The `description` slot allows you to customize the operation description.

```markdown
---
aside: false
outline: false
title: vitepress-openapi
---

<!--@include: ./parts/custom-slots-example.md-->
```

This will render the following:

::: info Custom description slot 
<!--@include: ./parts/custom-slots-example.md-->
:::
