# Code Samples

You can customize the `langs` to show, the `availableLangs`, and `generator` for Code Samples. For example, you can add [Bru Markup Language](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-lang/overview) to the list of languages to show and available languages to select from and a generator to convert the request object to Bru code.
